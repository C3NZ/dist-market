# Proposal

## Description
This project is an ERC 721 token where the assets are generated by the CNN!

## Token
The token itself is an ERC 721, and that is because it will be generating unique artistic images
based on random iterations that will belong to only the person that purchases them.

## Use case
I'm hoping that this project will create some freakish looking art that
someone may be interested in purchasing

## High level plan
1. Create the Neural Network
    * Image generation
    * Automatic content image fetching
    * Automatic style image fetching
2. ERC tokens
    * Tradeable and purchaseable ERC 721 tokens
    * Automatic minting
3. Contract audit
    * Research into best contract practices
    * Peer reviewa
    * Polishing
4. Deployment
    * Select a network to run the contract on
    * Deploy!
4. API layer (Stretch goal)
    * Connect to a node
    * Translate all contract functionality into endpoints
    * Write API documentation
